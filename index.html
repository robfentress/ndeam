                    <p>15% of world’s population have some form of disability.</p>
                    <p>Now, I could tell you that if you don't design with accessibility in mind, </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People with <em>mobility</em> disabilities may not be able to fill out forms on your sites; </li>
                        <li>People with <em>cognitive</em> disabilities might have a hard time understanding the message you are trying to convey; </li>
                        <li>People who are <em>deaf</em> may not be able to know what is going on in your videos. </li>
                        <li>I could tell you that that people who are <em>blind or low vision</em> may miss out on whatever you are trying to communicate with pictures</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But I hope the questions I asked previously have given you some sense of how this is not just about other, <em>hypothetical</em> people who may or may <em>not</em> be accessing your content. Whether you have a permanent disability
                        or not, you, personally, will almost certainly be affected, at one point or another, by someone's failure to consider the widest range of users and situations in their efforts to communicate.</p>

                    <b>Read:</b> We facilitate informal brown bag lunch meetings twice a week where we discuss topics in digital accessibility that folks are interested in. At these brown bags, people can also share what they’ve been working on and get
                    feedback from their peers and expert guidance to resolve any challenges they are facing. If you’d like to be notified of the topics for the meetings and be sent invitations to attend, sign up at tinyurl.com/vt-brown-bag.

                    <b>Read:</b> We also provide grants to help staff and faculty get professional certifications in web accessibility through the International Association of Accessibility Professionals. Those who are awarded the grants commit to serving
                    on a subcommittee that is drafting recommended processes for testing the accessibility of web resources at the university and for identifying critical needs for tools, training, and resources to achieve the university’s goals. Although
                    the application deadline for this round of grant funding has passed, we do offer grants twice a year, so if you are interested in applying, you can do so in the Spring. You can learn more about the program at assist.vt.edu/certgrant
                    (one word).
