                        different ways And a specific Success Criterion is that the content be structured using appropriate semantic elements so that the information about and relationships between elements on the page don't depend on specific sensory

                        <b>Read:</b> There are many other issues around providing alternative text, such what to do if the image is purely decorative and shouldn't be spoken, and how to describe very complex images. The Web Accessibility Initiative provides
                        guidance that I've linked to here.

                            <li><b>Read:</b> Because screen reader users can navigate by jumping from link to link using a key command, it is important that the text of any links describes their purpose. For instance, where the link takes the user or the
                                name of the document that would be downloaded. This saves these users time by letting them quickly navigate to where they need to go. </li>

                            <li><b>Read:</b> However, if the links contain more generic text, such as "Read more", especially if there are multiple "Read more" links, this affordance is less useful. </li>
                            <li>Reveal the next fragment</li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> Rather than saying "read more" or "click here", it is better for the link text to say "read more <em>about</em> x"</li>
                            <li>Reveal the next fragment</li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> This same principle is at play when an image is the only content of a link. Usually, the text alternative for an image should be a description of the image. However, if you did that in this case, the text that
                                would be spoken would be the image's alt text, which often will not describe the link's purpose. </li>
                            <li>Reveal the next fragment</li>
                            <li>Therefore, in those instance, you can change the alt text to describe the purpose of the link. </li>
                            <li>Reveal the next fragment</li>
                            <li>Alternately, you could set the image's alt attribute to the empty string, which causes it to be ignored by screen readers, and then provide additional text that is visually hidden but spoken by the screen reader, which descripbes
                                the link's purpose.</li>

                        <blockquote>Data tables are used to organize data with a logical relationship in grids. Accessible tables need HTML markup that indicates header cells and data cells and defines their relationship. Assistive technologies use this information
                            to provide context to users. Header cells must be marked up with TH, and data cells with TD to make tables accessible. For more complex tables, explicit associations may be needed using scope, id, and headers attributes.

                            <li><b>Read:</b> Screen readers will generally read the content on the page in the order it appears in the HTML. Usually this makes sense, but in some cases the order suggested by the way the page looks doesn't match the order
                                in the code. Let me show you an example.</li>
                            <li>Follow link to <a href="http://hirerobplease.com/demos/wai/bad/home.html" target="_blank">What is wrong with this?</a></li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> A user of the screen reader VoiceOver may read through the page essentially one line at a time by pressing <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd>. If we do that here, listen to what happens when
                                we get to the list of articles.</li>
                            <li>Use <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd> to read through the list of articles.</li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> Notice how the screen reader didn't read things based on the columnar layout. Why do you suppose that is</li>
                            <li>Right-click on the heading, <b>Heat wave linked to temperatures</b>, and choose <b>Inspect</b> to bring up the Inspector.</li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> Notice here how the person who coded the page placed all of the titles of the articles in a div with the class, <b>newsbar</b>. This styling made the titles appear in a sort of row. The screen reader doesn't know
                                that the content is visually organized in columns and that the title of the article should be read first, followed by the alt text for the pictures, and then the extract of the story. Instead, it just reads content as it
                                appears in the code, which in this case doesn't match the visual presentation.</li>
                            <li>Go back to the slide</li>

                            <li><b>Read:</b> So the lesson here is that the order of content in the HTML should match the order things should be read based on the visual presentation. Or if it is not exactly the same, it should still make sense.</li>

                            <li><b>Read:</b> If we look at the code on this fixed version of the page, we see a better approach.</li>
                            <li>Right-click on the heading, <b>Heat wave linked to temperatures</b>, and choose <b>Inspect</b> to bring up the Inspector.</li>
                            <li>In the Inspector, hover over the div containing the heading to show through the highlighting on the page that this now wraps the whole article, meaning everything will now be read in the right order.</li>

                            <li><b>Read:</b> here is a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag now and it is associated with its related field because its <code>for</code> attribute points to the

                            <li><b>Read:</b> There is also a required attribute. Because of this, the screen reader will announce to the user when he or she encounters this field that it is required. This is also what causes focus to be shifted to the field
                                when the form is submitted without anything being entered.
                            </li>
                            <li>Depending on time, you could also fill in the <b>Name</b>, <b>Email</b> and
                                <b>CAPTCHA</b> fields and submit the form, pointing out the voicing of the alert because the div with the message had <code>role="alert"</code></li>

                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> Let's take a quick look at a demonstration from the accessibility company SSB Bart--now LevelAccess--of an application that provides all this functionality and more, ZoomText.
                            </li>
                            <li>Play video until <b>0:42</b>, which will show color, contrast, pointer, and cursor enhancements. Then skip to <b>1:25</b>, where it talks about how magnification can affect one's ability to notice form error notifications.
                            </li>
                            <li>Pause the video when it reaches <b>2:01</b></li>
                            <li>Explain that the view, when zoomed in, follows the focus, so it is important to note that, if something appears outside of a users field of view when they click a button, it is often best to shift focus to whatever appears.
                            </li>
                            <li>Ask if they remember a similar issues from when we demonstrated form submission on the Accessible University page.
                            </li>
                            <li>Play the video and pause it when it reaches <b>2:16</b>.</li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> There are many ways to magnify content to make text more readable. Magnification of the entire screen as shown is just one, and, as mentioned has the disadvantage of requiring scrolling in two dimensions in order
                                to read text.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>One other way to magnify things that doesn't require separate software is to <b>use your browsers native zooming</b> functionality. </li>
                                    <li>For instance in Safari I can magnify the page by pressing <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd> or choosing <b>Zoom In</b> from the <b>View</b> menu. </li>
                                    <li>This will make the text bigger, but can cause problems with horizontal scrolling unless you are using responsive design techniques that transform the layout as the viewport size decreases, which is essentially what
                                        is happening when you use Browser Zoom.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Some people may not want to zoom the entire page, and may prefer to just make the text on the page bigger. For instance, you can <b>set your preferred text size</b> in Chrome's preferences window.</li>
                                    <li>This should not cause content to reflow, as with browser zoom, and, therefore, this may be a preferable strategy for some users. </li>
                                    <li>However, unlike browser zoom, this technique only works if the page has been coded to use relative units for font size. These relative units include em, rem, %, and keywords like large.</li>
                                    <li>However, if you use pixels, points, or inches as your units when setting font size, because these are absolute measures, they will not change when the user sets their preferred text size in their browser's preferences.</li>
                                    <li>Another thing to be careful of it that your page design will accommodate having the user set their text to be up to 200% of its normal size, without any of the text becoming truncated or overlapping other context and
                                        thus becoming unreadable.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li><b>Read:</b> Color blindness, also known as color vision deficiency, is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color. For instance, eople with normal vision should see the number "74". Many people who are color

                            <li><b>Read:</b> Assistive Technologies or techniques that people with color blindness may employ are custom stylesheets and tools to enhance contrast. For instance, I knew one user who on a certain site had trouble distinguishing
                                links from the text that surrounded the links in a paragraph, because the contrast ratio between the two colors used was too small. He dealt with the problem by applying a custom stylesheet that added an underline to all
                                links on that site.

                        <li><b>Read:</b> Although there are no official minimum font size requirements in WCAG, usually, you would not want to go below 16 CSS pixels. And, of course, this varies based on your purpose. For instance, 16px text would generally
                            be too small for important text on slides.</li>

                        <li><b>Read:</b> Text with poor contrast can make things less readable generally, not just for people with visual disabilities.</li>

                        <li><b>Read:</b> Lines of text that are longer than 72 characters wide can make it more difficult for users to track to the next line and interfere with readability. Avoid long paragraphs. Where it makes sense, use bulleted or numbered
                            lists to make content easier to digest.</li>
